Feature: Sort Players
  As a aaa
  So that I can find the iplayers I'm looking for
  I want to be able to sort players by overall ehp and account type

  Background: players have been added to database

    Given the following players exist:
    | player_name | player_acc_type |
    | UncleTomas  | HC              |
    | Tyrone P    | Reg             |
